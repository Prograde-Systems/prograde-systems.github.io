In this post, we walk through the development of our custom flight computer used in the Prograde hybrid rocket.

## Goals

- Real-time data logging (IMU, GPS, pressure sensors)
- Pyrotechnic control for staging and recovery
- Compact form factor and thermal resilience

## Architecture Overview

We used a STM32 microcontroller with custom PCB layout. Here's a high-level diagram of the system:

## Lessons Learned

- Watch for IMU sensor drift
- Isolate noisy power lines
- Use redundant EEPROM for fault recovery

Stay tuned for our full hardware schematics and codebase coming soon.
