**Prograde Systems** is an open-source, collaborative initiative focused on experimental rocketry and independent aerospace research. Our mission is to develop and share high-quality tools, designs, and knowledge that support advanced rocketry and avionics projects.

This site serves as the central hub for our documentation efforts. It includes detailed technical articles, reference materials, and development notes covering a range of topics including flight computer design, navigation and control software, and systems integration.

By publishing our work openly, we aim to create a transparent and reusable foundation for student teams, independent researchers, and contributors interested in building robust, modern rocketry systems.
